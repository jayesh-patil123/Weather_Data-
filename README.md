The Project Title: Weather Data Analysis Project
Objective: The project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of a time-series weather dataset. The dataset provides per-hour information about various weather parameters recorded at a specific location.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features of the Dataset:
Attributes:
Temperature: Measures the atmospheric heat.
Dew Point Temperature: Indicates the temperature at which air becomes saturated with moisture.
Relative Humidity: Shows the percentage of moisture in the air relative to saturation.
Wind Speed: Captures the movement of air, measured in units like km/h or mph.
Visibility: Describes how far one can clearly see.
Pressure: Atmospheric pressure indicating weather conditions.
Condition: General weather descriptions like "Clear" or "Rainy".
Format: Stored in a CSV file.

Steps in the Analysis:
Data Loading:
The Pandas library is used to load the dataset into a DataFrame for easier manipulation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Preliminary exploration of the dataset using commands like data.head(), which reveals the structure and content of the dataset.

Objective of Analysis:
Understand trends: Analyze weather variations over time.
Correlation insights: Identify relationships between different weather parameters.
Data summary: Generate statistical summaries like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features.

Techniques & Tools:
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
(Placeholder for potential extensions like visualizations with Matplotlib or Seaborn).

Potential Outcomes:
Gain insights into weather patterns for informed decision-making.
Build predictive models using historical weather data (optional extensions).
Understand environmental trends and anomalies.
